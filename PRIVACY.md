## Collection of Audio

DiscordVCListener records all audio in voice channels that it is connected to. This audio is held on the DiscordVCListener server while a recording is occurring. This audio may be stored indefinitely; however, deletion of audio after transferring the recorded files to you is standard procedure. Usernames, Discriminators, and User IDs are stored alongside the audio. As DiscordVCListener cannot control the actions of its users, this audio may be shared with third parties by any other third party user of DiscordVCListener, but is not shared by DiscordVCListener itself. Audio may be shared with DiscordVCListener developers for the purpose of debugging and improving the DiscordVCListener service, when explicitly asked by you. This audio may be shared with Discord for the purpose of debugging and improving the Discord service, or providing evidence of Terms of Service violations. This audio may be shared with law enforcement for the purpose of providing evidence of illegal activity. This audio may be shared with any third party for any purpose. This data is collected for the following purposes:

- To provide the DiscordVCListener service
- Improve the playback of audio

DiscordVCListener does not collect any data other than audio and the associated metadata. DiscordVCListener does not collect any data from any source other than from the connected Discord voice channel.

## Your Rights

You have the right to request a copy of all audio recorded of you. You have the right to request the deletion of all audio recorded of you. However, audio already deleted cannot be provided, regardless of circumstances.

## Technology

While DiscordVCListener maintainers make an effort to keep all data secure, there is no guarantee of the security of any Internet-accessible system. They cannot be held liable for access to your private information through illegal intrusion, even if it can be construed as a consequence of their negligence.

## Misc

Any discord server usage of DiscordVCListener must make a conscious effort to inform users that they are liable to be recorded, and held liable for their actions. Servers must have an ability for users to opt out of recordings. DiscordVCListener maintainers are not liable for any legal action taken against you for recording users without their consent.
